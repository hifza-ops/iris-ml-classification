# Iris Flower Classification 🌸

This project uses a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict the species of iris flowers based on their physical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## 📌 Purpose

This beginner-level project teaches how machines can learn from data to make predictions. It introduces key steps of the machine learning pipeline: data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

### ✅ Real-World Relevance
- **Botanists** and researchers can use models like this to automatically classify flower species.
- It's a simplified version of ML systems used in **agriculture**, **medical imaging**, and **automated decision-making**.
- Shows how AI helps **save time**, reduce manual errors, and improve research workflows.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- seaborn & matplotlib
- scikit-learn (RandomForestClassifier)

## 🔍 Accuracy
Achieved over 90% accuracy on test data using Random Forest.
